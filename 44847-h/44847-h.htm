<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> publishers wish to call the attention of
the little candy maker to the Appendix in this
book.</p>

<p>The United States Food Administration, while
it does not object to a moderate use of sugar in
candy making, strongly advises that it be used
sparingly in order that our soldiers and allies
may be provided with this energy-giving food
that they require.</p>

<p>Accordingly, a number of recipes requiring
a small quantity of sugar, or eliminating it entirely,
have been prepared under the direction
of this able Administration, and the publishers,
glad to co-operate in every way, take pleasure in
incorporating these recipes and suggestions as
an Appendix.</p>

<p>It should be noted, however, that the author
has furnished, throughout the book, a number of
recipes that conform in every way to the suggestions
made by the Government.</p>

<div class='adtitle2'>A LITTLE CANDY BOOK<br />
FOR A LITTLE GIRL</div>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2>CHAPTER I<br />
<small>COOL WEATHER CANDIES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betsey Bobbitt</span> was a little girl whose real
name was Elizabeth, but who, whenever she had
anything to tell, came rushing to her mother and
bobbed about so much&mdash;just couldn't keep
still&mdash;that she earned the name Betsey Bobbitt.</p>

<p>Now, the funny part about the nickname
was that it was not always appropriate; it only
fitted when she came bobbing in with "Oh,
mother!" and back and forth she would bob,
like&mdash;like&mdash;well, if you ever saw a restless
tiger at the circus, or at the zoo, pace back and
forth in his cage bobbing his head, you will
know just how Betsey Bobbitt looked as she told
her little story.</p>

<p>Like most little girls, Betsey Bobbitt would
often run errands for the neighbors and nearly
always they would insist upon giving Betsey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
Bobbitt a penny, saying: "Thank you, dear;
now buy yourself a stick of candy."</p>

<p>Poor Betsey Bobbitt how she did wish she
might buy the candy, because if there was anything
Betsey Bobbitt liked it was candy; and
poor, poor mother how <i>she</i> wished the neighbors
would not be so kind, or rather unkind, for she
had tried ever since Betsey Bobbitt first tasted
candy to let her eat only those candies that were
pure and wholesome!</p>

<p>It truly was hard, because while mother had
carefully explained that "penny candies" were
unsafe for little children to eat, on account of
the cheap, impure materials used in the making,
as well as the bright, dangerous colors used upon
the outside, to make them look attractive, still
Betsey Bobbitt could not understand why other
little girls and boys were allowed to eat them.</p>

<p>Mother said she was sure the other mothers of
little children did not realize how harmful they
were, because if they did, they would never allow
their little girls and boys to eat them.</p>

<p>So Betsey Bobbitt tried to feel that mother
was right about it, but she couldn't quite forget
those "sticks of candy."</p>

<p>One afternoon in early September, Betsey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Bobbitt and several little schoolmates, on their
way home from school, were very busily engaged
in talking, and what do you think they were
talking about? They were discussing what they
wanted to do when they grew up.</p>

<p>At first Betsey Bobbitt was very quiet; this
was most unusual, but she listened attentively
to the plans of all the others. Just then they
came to a candy shop in which was displayed
a most tempting array of candies.</p>

<p>Like a flash Betsey Bobbitt made her decision,
and when she said she wanted to be a teacher of
"Domestic Science" the other little girls were
so impressed that their own plans were forgotten;
in fact some of them did not even know
what "Domestic Science" meant and they were
very eager to learn.</p>

<p>So Betsey Bobbitt explained as best she
could, what she knew about it and how she ever
came to think of such a future; she told them
of her mother's friend who went to college to
learn how to become a teacher of "Domestic
Science," which included knowing how to cook
just everything, the best of all being the most,
<i>oh! most</i> delicious candies, and that was what
she, Betsey Bobbitt, wanted to study.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>The little girls were very much excited and
looked first at the pretty candies wistfully and
then at Betsey Bobbitt with awe as it seemed to
them very wonderful for any one to be able to
make such delicious candies.</p>

<p>Betsey Bobbitt herself was so enthused that
she could not wait for the others, so with another
hasty glance at the candies and a hurried goodbye
to her friends she left them and ran all the
way home to tell mother about her wonderful
plan for the future.</p>

<p>Mother knew at once that something very
special must have happened and as soon as
Betsey could gain her breath it all came out.</p>

<p>When Betsey Bobbitt finished her story she
received the happiest surprise of her short life,
for mother, seeing how earnest and eager her
little girl was over her new plan, had been
thinking rapidly, and so when all had been told
Betsey's mother laughed merrily at her little
daughter and said: "Why wait until you are
old enough to go to college? Wouldn't you like
to begin to learn now?"</p>

<p>Do you wonder Betsey Bobbitt nearly fell off
her chair, for when she really understood that
mother was to teach her to make candy, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
bobbed about all over the room, exclaiming:
"Oh! mother, may I really and truly?" and,
again: "Oh! mother, I don't think I'll even
want to look at penny candy again!"</p>

<p>This pleased mother so much that she began
at once to look up all the simple ways of making
candy that she herself had learned when she
was a little girl like Betsey, as well as many
that had been given to her or that she had cut
from favorite magazines and cook books.</p>

<p>When these recipes were all arranged, Betsey
Bobbitt began her candy making, and a happy,
busy winter and spring she had indeed.</p>

<p>Mother did not get any special outfit, but
just let Betsey use the things she had in the
house and which would generally be found in
any ordinary home, some of which were as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Aluminum and agate saucepans, one, two
and three quarts; a double boiler; two glass and
one tin half-pint measuring cups (divided into
quarters, thirds and halves); a set of spoons
(measuring one tablespoon, one dessert spoon,
one teaspoon, one half teaspoon and one fourth
teaspoon); an old large steel knife that had
become very flexible with constant use; scales;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
food-chopper; nut-cracker; corn-popper; a long
handled wooden spoon; a small brush for buttering
tins; a fine wire strainer for sifting confectioner's
sugar; one large and one small egg-beater;
and a pair of scissors kept specially for
kitchen use.</p>

<p>Mother also wrote out the following rules
for measuring and weighing and hung them up
so that Betsey could find them easily. These
Betsey found very helpful.</p>

<p>The hints for candy making that mother gave
Betsey, and which she memorized, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First.</span> To butter with a brush the inside of
the saucepan from the top about two inches
down, to prevent the candy from boiling over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second.</span> To use fresh, cold water each time
she tried the candy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Third.</span> Any candy that is to be beaten is
better if allowed to cool a few minutes by standing
the pan in cold water and if when beaten it
looks like smooth thick cream before pouring
in pans.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fourth.</span> To butter the hands well when pulling
candies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fifth.</span> That "soft ball," "hard ball,"
"thread," and "brittle" mean the different
stages sugar reaches while cooking.</p>

<p>When a little syrup dropped in cold water
can be easily worked between the thumb and
finger, it is a "soft ball;" when it is firm and
solid, it is a "hard ball;" when it drops from
the spoon into a fine thread, it is called "thread;"
and when it becomes so hard it will break, it is
called "brittle."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sixth.</span> Never to stir hard candies (unless
told to do so) after ingredients are well mixed
and have reached the point where the syrup
"threads."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Seventh.</span> That uncooked foundation cream
and fondant cream can be made into all sorts of
candies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eighth.</span> That pretty, harmless colorings
may be made from the following: different
shades of red and pink from the juice of raspberries,
strawberries, blackberries, elderberries
and cranberries; yellow from saffron; and green
from spinach and beet leaves bruised and boiled
in a very little water.</p>

<p>So Betsey followed every instruction carefully
and these are the candies "Betsey Bobbitt"
learned to make.</p>

<p>Betsey chose to make the hard candies first,
and mother told her she had chosen well as the
cool fall and cold winter weather were much
better for these candies as they did not become
so sticky and hard to handle as in warm weather.
One thing in particular mother impressed upon
Betsey's mind was this: it would be much easier
to have all the materials and utensils, used in
making the candy, ready, <i>before</i> the cooking
began; and another equally important thing was
to wash all the dishes and pans and leave everything
tidy and in order when finished.</p>


<h3>Butter Scotch No. 1</h3>



<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (brown),</td>
<td align="right">2<small><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> cups<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter,</td>
<td align="right">½ cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water (cold),</td>
<td align="right">2 tablespoons</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>When Betsey put these all in the saucepan,
she remembered to dip her brush in melted butter
and brush the pan about two inches down
from the top so that the candy would not boil
over, then she let the syrup boil, without stirring,
until a little which she dropped from the
spoon formed a hard ball in cold water. It was
then ready to pour (thinly) in buttered pans
and mark, at once, in squares.</p>

<p>This was Betsey's favorite recipe for butter
scotch although she found the following two
recipes very nice.</p>


<h3>Butter Scotch No. 2</h3>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Corn Syrup,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>

<tr><td align="left">Vinegar,</td>
<td align="right">1 teaspoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter,</td>
<td align="right">½ cup</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>Betsey put the sugar, corn syrup, vinegar and
butter in the saucepan, then dipping her brush
in melted butter she brushed the top of the
saucepan two inches down, next she stirred the
ingredients well together before putting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
saucepan on the stove, because after the syrup
began to cook it must not be stirred.</p>

<p>When it was boiling well Betsey tried a few
drops in cold water every little while (each time
remembering to use fresh water), and when it
formed a hard ball she knew it was done.</p>

<p>The buttered pans were all ready and into
these Betsey poured the candy (thinly) and
marked it at once into squares.</p>


<h3>Butter Scotch No. 3</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Molasses,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>

</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter,</td>
<td align="right">1 tablespoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Flavoring (lemon),</td>
<td align="right">½ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>After the molasses, sugar and butter were
put into the saucepan and the saucepan had
been well brushed two inches down from the
top as mother instructed, Betsey let them cook
until the syrup reached the hard ball stage
when a little of it was dropped in cold water.</p>

<p>It was then time to add the flavoring and
pour at once into the buttered pans, not forgetting
to mark in squares.</p>

<p>Betsey found that butter scotch was much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
more tasty when thin, so that was why she buttered
more than one pan and had it only a
quarter of an inch thick.</p>

<p>Betsey put everything except the butter and
vanilla into the saucepan and boiled these until
the syrup formed a hard ball when a little was
tried in cold water, then the butter and vanilla
were added, and it was cooked three minutes
more (Betsey counted up to one hundred and
eighty) and poured into a large buttered pan.</p>


<h3>Lemon Cream Candy</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsey dissolved the sugar in the water and
let it come to the boiling point, then she added
the cream of tartar, which she first dissolved in
one teaspoon of hot water, and when the candy
was nearly done she put in the piece of butter.</p>

<p>When a little of the syrup dropped in cold
water formed a hard ball it was then time to
add the flavoring and pour in a buttered pan
to cool.</p>

<p>While the candy was cooling Betsey greased
her finger-tips well, and when the candy was
cool enough to handle Betsey began to pull it;
at first she found it very awkward but mother
showed her just how to do it and before long
Betsey could do it very nicely. This pulling,
as mother explained, was very <i>quick</i> work.
Then when the candy was white Betsey cut it
into small pieces with the scissors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>

<p>The sugar and water were put into the saucepan
and let come to the boiling point, then the
cream of tartar was dissolved in one teaspoon
of hot water and Betsey added it to the sugar
and water. She let these cook, and just before
they reached the hard ball stage, added the
butter.</p>

<p>When the hard ball formed, by dropping a
little of the syrup in cold water, the vanilla was
added and the candy was poured in a buttered
pan to cool.</p>

<p>In the meantime Betsey greased her finger-tips,
and as soon as the candy was cool enough
to handle she began to pull it. Betsey had to
work quickly and as soon as the candy was white
she cut it into small pieces.</p>

dissolved in one teaspoon of hot water and
continued to boil until a little of the syrup
dropped in cold water had nearly reached the
hard ball stage, then she added the butter.</p>

<p>When it had quite reached the hard ball stage
Betsey took it from the fire, dropped in the four
drops of peppermint and poured the candy into
a buttered pan to cool.</p>

<p>Greasing her finger-tips just as she did for
the lemon and vanilla cream candy, Betsey proceeded
to pull until white and then cut it in
small pieces.</p>


<h3>Betsey's Orange Cream Candy</h3>

</table></div>

<p>Betsey called this her own recipe, because,
while it was made exactly like the "Lemon,"
"Vanilla," and "Peppermint Cream Candy,"
she said to mother one day, "Why can't I use
orange flavoring and have still another
change?" Mother told her there was no reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
at all why she couldn't, and that she was glad
to see Betsey thinking out new combinations for
herself.</p>

<p>So Betsey was delighted, and once more
mother wrote it out, for, as Betsey said, "It
was much easier to have it right before you
under its own name than to keep turning back
to the recipes that had gone before."</p>

<p>The sugar and water were brought to the
boiling point, the cream of tartar was dissolved
in one teaspoon of hot water and added; these
she let boil until a little dropped in cold water
was almost hard, then Betsey put in the butter.
When it was quite hard she took it from the
fire, added the orange flavoring and poured at
once into the buttered pan to cool.</p>

<p>Betsey found she had time to wash her saucepan,
spoon and other dishes before she needed
to grease her fingers, and thus made the kitchen
more tidy and attractive while she pulled the
candy.</p>

<p>After Betsey began to think for herself she
acted in such an important manner that mother
smiled to see how rapidly her little daughter
was advancing.</p>

<p>The sugar, water and vinegar were measured
carefully into the saucepan, well mixed, then
placed upon the stove to boil. One thing in
particular that Betsey learned from her own
experience was never to let any candy she was
making boil too hard; an even steady boil made
the candy much nicer, and, besides, it did not
then "spit" all over the stove and make the unpleasant
odor of burned sugar in the house.</p>

<p>Betsey tried the candy in cold water and just
before it formed a hard ball she added the butter;
when it formed a ball that was quite hard
she removed the saucepan from the fire, added
the lemon flavoring and poured into the buttered
pan.</p>

<p>With fingers well greased she pulled the
candy, as soon as it was cool enough to handle
comfortably, until it was very white, then cut it
into small pieces with a pair of scissors.</p>

<p>Betsey let the sugar, water and vinegar

added just before it was done and the orange
flavoring as soon as it was taken from the stove.</p>

<p>Pouring the candy into the buttered pan,
Betsey let it stand until she could handle it easily,
then with well-greased fingers she pulled the

cold water, formed a hard ball. Just before it
reached this stage Betsey slipped in the butter.</p>

<p>As soon as it was done Betsey took it from the
fire, added the vanilla, poured into the buttered
pan, let it cool until she could handle it, then
greased her fingers and pulled until it was quite
white and cut into small pieces.</p>

<p>When the sugar, vinegar and water had
boiled long enough so that a little of the syrup,
dropped in cold water, formed a hard ball, it
was poured into a buttered pan, let cool sufficiently
and pulled. It was very simple, since
Betsey did not have to stir this while cooking or
add anything extra.</p>


<h3>Cream of Tartar Candy</h3>

put in the saucepan and well stirred, then
boiled until a little of the syrup, dropped in cold
water, formed the usual hard ball. Betsey found
this took about twenty minutes. Then she
poured the candy into a buttered pan and let it
cool so that she could handle it easily.</p>

<p>With well-greased fingers she pulled the
candy quickly, then cut into small pieces or
short sticks with the scissors.</p>

<p>This Betsey found to be delicious. She
cooked all of the ingredients together, and when
a little of the candy, dropped in cold water, was
quite hard, she poured it into the buttered pan.
When the candy was cool Betsey marked it into
squares.</p>

<p>Most little girls like molasses candy and
Betsey was no exception; she thought the
recipes that follow were the best of the kind she
had ever tasted.</p>

<p>Betsey put all the above named ingredients
except the soda into her saucepan to boil. When
a little of the syrup, dropped in cold water, became
brittle, she took the saucepan off the stove,
and added the soda; then she poured the candy
into the buttered pan.</p>

<p>When it was cool enough to handle Betsey
greased her fingers and pulled the candy until
it was a shiny golden brown, then with the
scissors cut it into short sticks.</p>


<h3>Peanut Molasses Candy (not Pulled)</h3>

until they formed a hard ball when tried in
cold water, then she added the vinegar and continued
cooking until it became brittle.</p>

<p>The buttered pan was ready with the peanuts
in and the candy was poured over them.
Before it became quite cool Betsey marked it in
squares.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Betsey thought pulling candy the best kind
of fun and after she learned perfectly how not
to get all sticky, mother allowed her to invite a
few of her little friends to have a "pulling bee."</p>

<p>This pleased Betsey and her little friends
very much. One of the little girls said she
knew what a "husking bee" was, for once when
she was in the country at the time when the
corn was full grown, all the friends and neighbors
round about had been invited to come and
help with the husking.</p>

<p>Betsey's mother told the little girl a "pulling
bee" was the same idea exactly, for they were
to come and help pull the candy after it was
cooked.</p>

<p>Each little girl put on one of mother's big
aprons and carefully washed her hands, then
Betsey read the names of the different recipes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
out loud and mother said they might choose
two to make.</p>

<p>They chose "Betsey's Orange Cream Candy"
on page <a href="#Page_22">22</a> and "Molasses Candy" given on
page <a href="#Page_28">28</a>.</p>

<p>Mother stayed with them in case they needed
her help, although Betsey took full charge.</p>

<p>Betsey certainly managed well, for she kept
each little girl busy doing her share, and when
the candy was cooked and ready to pull the
real fun started.</p>

<p>Despite Betsey's careful teaching, mother's
help was much needed in assisting some of the
little girls, who just could not help getting
all sticky.</p>

<p>The afternoon passed so quickly and the
candy was so good that the little crowd voted
it to be the best time they had ever had.</p>

<p>The following week Betsey made:</p>

<p>The molasses, water, sugar, honey and corn
syrup Betsey measured carefully into the saucepan,
and cooked them until when tried in cold
water the syrup formed the usual hard ball.
Pouring the candy into the buttered pan, Betsey
let it cool until she could handle it easily. With
well-greased fingers she pulled the candy, then
cut in pieces and wrapped in wax paper.</p>

from the fire, she added the lemon juice and
poured the candy into a buttered pan, greased
her fingers well, and pulled when sufficiently cool.
Then with the scissors she cut in small pieces.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Once when Betsey's mother was a young girl
she visited a large farm in northern Vermont
and it was there she had her first butternuts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsey thought the recipes for butternut
candy that follow were the best ever.</p>

<p>After Betsey boiled the sugar and water
without stirring until thick enough to spin a
fine thread, she added the flavoring, placed her
pan in cold water, and then stirred it very
quickly until it was white, added the nuts, and
poured into a buttered pan.</p>

<p>When it was cold she cut the candy into small
squares.</p>


<h3>Orange Butternut Candy</h3>

<p>Putting the sugar and water in the saucepan,
Betsey let them boil without stirring until it
would spin a fine thread from the tip of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
spoon. The orange juice was added, and the
pan placed in cold water and stirred very
quickly until it was white. Now Betsey added
the nuts and poured into a buttered pan, and
when cold she cut the candy into small squares.</p>


<h3>Vanilla Butternut Candy</h3>

<p>Like the "Lemon" and "Orange Butternut
Candy," Betsey put the sugar and water on to
boil without stirring. When a fine thread spun
itself from the tip of the spoon she removed the
saucepan from the fire, added the vanilla flavoring
and stood it in cold water.</p>

<p>Stirring the candy very quickly until it was
white, Betsey then added the nuts and poured it
into a buttered pan. When it was cold she cut
the candy into small squares.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Another candy that Betsey was very fond of
was peanut brittle, and she was eager to make
some of her own.</p>

<p>Mother told her it was very easy to make if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
you were only careful not to let the sugar burn
and worked quickly, so one day Betsey made this</p>


<h3>Peanut Brittle</h3>

<p>For this Betsey had to have a slow fire.
Mother told her to put the sugar into the iron
frying-pan, and explained how it would first
lump, then gradually melt, and that when it was
a clear pale coffee color it was ready to pour
quickly over the nuts.</p>

<p>Betsey had put the peanuts in a buttered pan
on the back of the range so as to be ready the
minute the sugar was properly melted.</p>

<p>Here is another candy with peanuts that
Betsey liked.</p>

<p>The sugar, syrup and water Betsey boiled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
until it was crisp or brittle when tried in cold
water. Just before taking from the fire she
added the butter and nuts, then poured into
buttered pans.</p>

<p>Betsey also made</p>

<p>After the sugar, milk and cream of tartar
were put in the saucepan Betsey set it on the
back of the range until it looked clear and
watery. Then she brought it forward and when
the boiling point was reached, let it boil one
minute, or while she counted sixty. Taking it
from the fire, she added the oil of peppermint
drops and beat until the candy was creamy, then
quickly dropped from tip of spoon on waxed
paper.</p>

<p>Sometimes this hardened before Betsey could
get it all dropped, but putting the saucepan
back on the stove, it would melt and she could
finish the dropping.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<small>POPCORN GOODIES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span> was glad when mother decided on
"Popcorn Goodies," for she found it such splendid
fun popping the corn.</p>

<p>How Betsey loved to watch the kernels burst
into the pretty white snowflakes!</p>

<p>Her first attempt was just plain hot buttered
popcorn.</p>

<p>Mother was busily explaining this recipe to
Betsey when Dorothy, Betsey's dearest friend,
came over to spend the afternoon. Mother invited
the little guest to share the fun of popping
the corn, and on observing how well the little
girls worked together then and there gave
Dorothy a standing invitation to join in the
candy-making whenever she could find the time,
and, you may be sure, the invitation was eagerly
accepted.</p>

<h3>Hot Buttered Corn</h3>

</table></div>

<p>Mother saw that the fire was just right, not
too hot nor too cold.</p>

<p>She told Betsey that if it was too hot the
kernels of corn did not heat evenly and you
were apt to burn them; so Betsey followed
every instruction, and as the corn popped so
also did Betsey's eyes pop with excitement to
see the little kernels turn inside out.</p>

<p>The half-cup of corn she found made about
six cups of popped corn.</p>

<p>Betsey's mother was very particular about
having her use only the corn that popped perfectly;
the imperfect corn was thrown away.</p>

<p>While Betsey was popping the corn, the butter
had been standing in a large bowl in the
warm kitchen, so that it was soft and creamy
(mother said it was not so nice if you let the
butter melt to oil), and while the corn was still
warm, Betsey added it to the creamy butter,
stirring all the time, then with the salt shaker
she shook the fine salt through the corn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>This buttered corn was so good it was quickly
eaten, so Betsey often made double quantity,
and many a cold winter's day she and her dearest
friend popped corn. Sometimes Betsey made</p>


<h3>Brown Sugar Popcorn Candy</h3>


<div class="center">

<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>A saucepan containing the sugar, water and
butter was placed on the back of the stove to
melt the ingredients while Betsey popped the
corn, one half a cup at a time. While the candy
was cooking she carefully picked over the corn,
using only the kernels that were perfectly
popped, and put them in a large saucepan at
the back of the stove.</p>

<p>When the candy became brittle as soon as a
little was dropped in cold water, Betsey poured
it over the corn, stirred and mixed it well, removed
from fire and continued to stir until the
candy cooled a little.</p>

<p>It was then poured into a buttered pan, a
heavy weight placed on the top (mother had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
show her how) and as soon as it was cold Betsey
cut it into bars with a very sharp knife. Sometimes
the knife would stick while cutting, but
mother said if she would dip the blade in water
now and then she would find it much easier.</p>

</table></div>

<p>First Betsey popped the corn, putting one
half a cup in the popper at a time; after picking
the corn over carefully she had about twelve
cups or three quarts of popped corn.</p>

<p>Then the sugar, water, and butter were put
in a saucepan and cooked until it was brittle,
when tried in cold water; the popped corn,
which had been kept in a large saucepan at back
of the stove, was then covered with the syrup,
stirred until it was well mixed, then taken from
fire and the stirring continued till the mixture
cooled a little. Now she poured it into a buttered
pan, placed a weight over it, and when cold cut
into bars with a sharp knife. If the knife stuck<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
while cutting, Betsey dipped the blade in water
now and then, as mother had taught her.</p>

<td align="left">1 cup</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The corn Betsey popped, picked over and put
in a good-sized buttered pan, then shook just a
little salt over it.</p>

<p>The butter, sugar and molasses she boiled
until it became brittle when tried in cold water,
then poured the candy slowly over the corn,
stirring all the while.</p>

<p>Betsey then buttered her hands and shaped
the corn into balls as soon as it was cool enough
for her to handle.</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar Popcorn Balls</h3>

</table></div>

<p>As Betsey became more and more expert in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
making candy she found she could plan many
ways to save time.</p>

<p>Having everything ready to work with at
the beginning made the work far easier.</p>

<p>So while Betsey popped the corn, the maple
syrup, sugar and butter were busily boiling.</p>

<p>Of course Betsey had to work quickly and
put her whole mind on what she was doing.
By the time the corn was popped, carefully
picked over and placed in a good-sized buttered
pan, then sprinkled with a little salt, the candy
was about done. She tried a little in cold water,
and when it became brittle she poured it slowly
over the corn, constantly stirring.</p>

<p>When it was cool enough to handle, Betsey,
with well-buttered fingers, shaped it into balls,
which she wrapped in waxed paper.</p>


<h3>How to Sugar Popcorn</h3>

<p>Betsey, after first popping the corn, put the
sugar, water and butter in a saucepan. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
the candy was boiling Betsey added the popcorn
gradually, until all had been added that
the syrup would cover, then stirred gently
from the bottom until the sugar formed grains
on the corn.</p>

<p>It was then turned into a dish to cool.</p>


<h3>Frosted Popcorn</h3>

<p>This was very pretty. After the popcorn
was nicely popped and placed in a large buttered
saucepan Betsey cooked the molasses,
sugar and butter until it was brittle when tried
in cold water, poured it over the corn slowly
and mixed thoroughly. Over this she shook
an abundance of powdered sugar and mixed it in
until the kernels separated and rattled.</p>

<p>Betsey popped the corn, picked it over, then
placed in a large buttered saucepan. The
sugar, water and butter she cooked until a little
of the syrup, dropped in cold water, became
brittle, then she added enough strained strawberry
juice (a few drops at a time) to make it
just the shade of pink she liked best. This she
then poured over the corn slowly, stirring all the
while, next she shook an abundance of powdered
sugar over it all and stirred it in until the
kernels separated and rattled.</p>

to melt while Betsey popped the corn, one half
a cup at a time.</p>

<p>Picking it over carefully and throwing away
all those kernels that were not properly popped,
she placed the corn in a large buttered saucepan,
then cooked the syrup until a little dropped
in cold water became brittle. Adding the
strained cranberry juice a few drops at a time
until it became a brilliant red, Betsey slowly
poured the candy over the corn, stirring constantly,
then shaking an abundance of powdered
sugar over the corn, she stirred it in until each
kernel was separate.</p>

<p>This Betsey made just as she did the other
"Frosted Popcorn."</p>

<p>She popped the corn, one half a cup at a time,
picked it over and placed the perfect kernels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
in a large buttered saucepan, throwing away the
imperfect kernels.</p>

<p>The sugar, water, butter and chocolate were
cooked until a little of the syrup, dropped in
cold water, became brittle. It was then poured
slowly over the corn and stirred constantly.</p>

<p>The powdered sugar Betsey shook over the
corn in abundance and mixed until each kernel
separated and rattled.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At Christmas time Betsey made a number of
the different kinds of frosted popcorn. Some of
them she strung for the Christmas Tree and
others she used for filling little net bags.</p>

<p>The little net bags she made of different
colors, some red, some green and others of dark
blue and white net.</p>

<p>She put a few silver stars here and there on the
outside of each bag and filled them with the
frosted corn.</p>

<p>They were most attractive, and her little
friends, to each of whom she presented one,
thought they were wonderful, and marvelled at
Betsey's original ideas.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<small>FUDGE</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> the Christmas holidays were over and
the excitement incident thereto had abated,
Betsey was eager to continue her candy-making,
and when mother suggested fudge Betsey just
bobbed and bobbed, but finally said: "Oh, I
know that I will enjoy all of the different fudges,
but are you sure that you have them all,
mother?" Mother smiled at her little pupil's
enthusiasm and replied: "Well, Betsey, I may
not have all of the fudge recipes, but I am sure
I have a very large number, for fudge has
always been one of my favorite candies, and I
have always enjoyed making it in different
ways." And as the weeks went on Betsey made
the following fudges:</p>

<p>First mother explained to Betsey that to
have fudge very creamy was all-important, and
instructed her <i>not</i> to beat it until it became
sugary, but only until it looked like thick heavy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
cream, then it was ready to pour at once in the
buttered pan and mark in squares.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut Fudge</h3>

<tr><td align="left">Cocoanut (prepared),</td>
<td align="right">½ cup</td>

<p>All except the cocoanut Betsey let boil ten
minutes, took from the fire, added cocoanut, beat
till it thickened and poured into buttered pan.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Fudge</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<tr><td align="left">Flavoring (vanilla),</td>

<p>The sugar, milk and chocolate were dissolved
in the saucepan at back of stove, then brought
forward and boiled until Betsey could form a
soft ball between her thumb and fingers when a
little was dropped in cold water; taking the
saucepan from the stove, she placed it in a pan
of cold water, added the butter and vanilla, beat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
until it was like heavy cream, then poured
quickly into the buttered pan and marked in
squares.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When Betsey found how many different
"fudges" could be made she welcomed each
new recipe with glee.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Fudge with Molasses</h3>

<p>Putting the sugar, molasses, milk, chocolate

until they formed a soft ball when a little of
the syrup was dropped in cold water, then she
removed the saucepan from the fire, added the
vanilla and placed the saucepan in a pan of cold
water.</p>

<p>Beating the fudge until it looked about as
thick as heavy cream, Betsey poured it into a
buttered pan and marked in squares.</p>

<p>As before, Betsey put the sugar, milk, chocolate
and butter in the saucepan and on to boil
and let them cook until a little of the syrup
dropped in cold water formed a soft ball between
the thumb and finger, then adding the
vanilla, she removed the saucepan from the fire
and placed it in a pan of cold water. After
beating the fudge until it was as thick as heavy
cream, Betsey poured it into the buttered pan
and marked in squares.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>If mother happened to be out of chocolate,
which sometimes occurred, Betsey made a fudge
with cocoa or coffee.</p>


<h3>Fudge with Cocoa</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<td align="right">1 teaspoon</td>

</table></div>

<p>Betsey melted the butter in the saucepan first,
then added the cocoa gradually, and when it was
very smooth included the sugar and milk.
These she let boil until a little of the syrup
dropped in cold water formed a soft ball, then
removing the saucepan from the fire, she placed
it in a pan of cold water, added the vanilla, beat
the fudge until it was thick like heavy cream,
and poured it in the buttered pan and marked
in squares.</p>


<h3>Fudge with Coffee</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter,</td>
<td align="right">2 tablespoons</td>
</tr>
</table></div>
<p>Let sugar, coffee and butter cook until a little
dropped in cold water forms a soft ball, Betsey
explained to a friend of mother's who happened
in, remove saucepan from fire and stand in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
pan of cold water, then beat until it looks as
thick as nice heavy cream, when you pour at
once into a buttered pan and mark in squares.
The friend liked the coffee flavor so well that
she went home and made some for herself.</p>

<p>When Betsey began to add nuts, raisins, figs,
dates, marshmallows or marshmallow cream to
the different kinds of fudges, mother at first
thought it unnecessary to re-write the quantities
and directions, but Betsey exclaimed, "Why,
mother, it will be so much easier if I have each
recipe written out all by itself, then I won't
need to keep referring back!" and mother found
Betsey was right.</p>

<p>It saved all confusion, and, of course, Betsey
was only a little girl, so mother continued to
make each recipe complete in itself, regardless
of how little it might vary from one previously
given.</p>

<p>The sugar, milk, chocolate and butter Betsey
boiled until a little of the syrup dropped in cold
water formed a soft ball. Removing the saucepan
from the fire, she placed it in a pan of cold
water, added the vanilla and nuts, then beat
until it was thick like heavy cream. Pouring
quickly into a buttered pan, she marked it into
squares.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Pecan Fudge</h3>

<p>Mother told Betsey to shell the almonds and
measure them in the measuring cup, then put
them in a small bowl and cover with <i>boiling</i>
water for about a minute. This she did, then
drained off the water and the little brown skins
peeled off very easily. Next she cut them into
small pieces and they were ready for the fudge,
which she proceeded to make in the usual
manner.</p>

<p>The sugar, milk, chocolate and butter were
boiled until they formed a soft ball, when a
little of the syrup was dropped in cold water;
removing the saucepan from the fire, it was
placed in a pan of cold water and the nuts and
vanilla added, then Betsey beat it well until it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
was thick like rich, heavy cream and poured at
once into the buttered pan and marked in
squares.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Peanut Fudge</h3>

<p>Putting the sugar, milk, chocolate and butter
into a saucepan, Betsey let them boil until they
reached the "soft ball" stage, then removing
from the fire she placed the saucepan in a pan of
cold water, added the peanuts and vanilla and
beat until it was thick like heavy cream. Pouring
at once into a buttered pan, she marked the
candy in squares.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Raisin Fudge</h3>


<div class="center">

</table></div>

<p>After measuring out the sugar, milk, chocolate
and butter, Betsey put them on to boil, and
while these were cooking so the syrup formed a
soft ball when a little of it was dropped in cold
water, Betsey picked over the raisins and cut
each one in halves. Sometimes she used the
seeded raisins or the small sultana raisins, or
again the "Not-a-seed" raisins. But whichever
she used, she first found it necessary to put
them in a bowl and cover with boiling water
that she might soften and separate them easily.</p>

<p>It only took a minute, and after draining
them carefully she turned them out on a towel
so that the extra moisture might be absorbed.</p>

<p>Then when the candy was done she added the
raisins and vanilla and placed the saucepan in
a pan of cold water. Next she beat the candy
well, and when it was as thick as heavy cream,

<p>These did not need to be cut, but any little

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There were still other combinations in the
fudges that Betsey could make, but she herself
was satisfied, for the time being, anyway, and
as she told mother, "On extra special occasions
I can add nuts to any of my recipes with
marshmallow cream."</p>

<p>Just before she started to make "Pinoche"
or "Brown Sugar Nougat," as her mother's
old recipe was called, mother received a letter
from a dear friend, who was much interested in
Betsey's candy making, in which she enclosed a
new recipe; strange to say it was another one
for fudge.</p>

<p>It was all written out on pretty pink paper.
This was it.</p>


<h3>Sour Milk Fudge</h3>

<p>Betsey first grated the chocolate and mixed it
well with the cornstarch and sugar, then added,
gradually, the sour milk.</p>

<p>These she cooked until a little of the syrup
tried in cold water formed a soft ball.</p>

<p>Removing from the fire, Betsey beat the fudge
until it began to sugar, then she added the butter
and chopped nuts.</p>

<p>Betsey learned that the longer you beat this
fudge the more creamy it became and it gave
a high gloss when cold.</p>

<p>Of course it was poured into a buttered pan
and marked in squares as usual.</p>


<h3>Brown Sugar Nougat or Pinoche</h3>

<p>The sugar and milk Betsey cooked until a

soft ball, then standing the saucepan in cold
water she added the butter, walnut meats and
vanilla, beat till it was thick like heavy cream,
poured quickly into a buttered pan and marked
in squares.</p>

<p>This was the candy that Betsey's father liked
best of all, and no matter how many other delicious
confections Betsey placed before him,
as she did from time to time, that he might test
the result of her earnest endeavors, he still persisted
in preferring "Brown Sugar Nougat."
He even insisted in preferring the old name
though, as Betsey told him, "Pinoche" was
more "up to date."</p>

<p>Betsey liked this recipe very much herself,
and even more so when she added two tablespoons
of the marshmallow cream, but as father
liked it best without the cream she usually made
it plain.</p>

<p>Mother thought she had lost a pet recipe until
one day she came upon it unexpectedly. This
was it.</p>

<p>For this Betsey needed two saucepans. In
one she put <i>two</i> cups of sugar, <i>one</i> cup of water,
the maple syrup and vinegar, boiled these until
they formed a soft ball in cold water, then removed
from fire.</p>

<p>In the second pan she had boiling the other
cup of sugar and the half cup of water; when
they had boiled so that the syrup formed a
thread from the tip of the spoon she poured it
at once on the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs,
beating continually, added <i>quickly</i> all this to
the first mixture, stirred in the nuts and vanilla,
beat until it was like cream and poured in buttered
pan. Sometimes Betsey packed it in a
deep, well buttered loaf pan and sliced like cake.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<small>CARAMELS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> Friday afternoon, as mother was sitting
at the window engaged in her sewing, Betsey
bobbed in and exclaimed: "Mother, I want to
make caramels!"</p>

<p>"Right now?" asked mother, looking up
from her sewing with a quizzical smile.</p>

<p>"Well, no, not just now," replied Betsey,
"but I really would like to make caramels."</p>

<p>Just why Betsey wanted to make caramels
puzzled mother, until Betsey told her of the
delicious caramels Dorothy's uncle sent her for
a birthday remembrance and which she had
shared with her little friend. "They were wonderful!"
sighed Betsey.</p>

<p>Mother looked at her daughter's wistful little
face and said: "To-morrow, dear, I will start
you on caramels, and I hope they will be just as
'wonderful' as the ones you had to-day; at
least some of them."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>So here are the different caramels that Betsey
made, and some of them Betsey agreed were
quite as "wonderful" as Dorothy's birthday
candy.</p>


<h3>Vanilla Corn Syrup Caramels</h3>

</table></div>

<p>After Betsey put the sugar, corn syrup,
water and vinegar in the saucepan she let them
boil six minutes before adding the butter, then
let them continue to boil until they formed a
soft ball when tried in cold water. Taking the
candy from the fire, she stirred in the vanilla
and sometimes one half cup of candied cherries
cut in halves, reheated the candy, then turned
into a buttered pan.</p>

<p>When the candy was cool Betsey marked it
in squares but did not cut it until it was
quite cold. She used a firm, sharp knife, then
wrapped each caramel in waxed paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother told Betsey she had heard that condensed
milk was considered by some expert
candy makers to give better results in caramels
than cream.</p>

<p>To the condensed milk Betsey added the water
and mixed thoroughly, then added the sugar.
She let these boil, then added the butter and
cream of tartar and continued the boiling until
a little of the syrup, dropped in cold water,
cracked between her thumb and finger.</p>

<p>It was then ready to take from the fire, add
vanilla, pour in buttered pan, mark in squares
when cool, cut with sharp knife when cold and
wrap in waxed paper.</p>

<p>When the sugar, syrup, <i>one</i> cup of cream and
butter reached the boiling point Betsey added
the other cup of cream a little at a time so that
the candy did not once stop boiling.</p>

<p>After trying it in cold water, and it formed a
firm ball between her thumb and finger, she
added the vanilla and nuts, turned it into a
buttered pan, marked into squares when cool,
cut with a sharp knife when cold and wrapped
in waxed paper.</p>

<p>Betsey found that these took a long, long
while to make, nearly an hour, but my! weren't
they worth it when she popped one into her
mouth!</p>

<p>Betsey let the chocolate, sugar, syrup and
milk boil until they formed a hard ball in cold
water, added the butter just before removing
from the fire, then the vanilla, and poured into
buttered pan, marked in squares when sufficiently
cool, cut with a sharp knife when cold
and wrapped in waxed paper.</p>

<p>As soon as the chocolate, sugar, corn syrup
and milk had cooked long enough so that a little
tried in cold water formed a hard ball, Betsey
added the butter to the mixture before removing
from the fire. When she removed the saucepan
she added the vanilla and nuts, poured into a
buttered pan, marked in squares when sufficiently
cool, cut with a sharp knife when cold
and wrapped in waxed paper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsey found that all candies worth eating
took time, patience and care to make, yet she
never seemed to tire of making them. Her enthusiasm
was just as fresh at each lesson and
mother felt well repaid for her time and trouble.</p>

<p>To be sure, Betsey had some failures, as most
little girls do, but she was never discouraged and
kept on practising until she had mastered every
recipe.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<small>CREAM CANDIES&mdash;UNCOOKED</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> candies that were made without cooking
were a constant source of delight, for Betsey
learned so many different ways of combining
them.</p>


<h3>Foundation Cream</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">White of</td>
<td align="right">1 egg</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Same amount of liquid.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (confectioner's),</td>
<td align="right">1 pound</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Flavoring.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey put the white of the egg in the glass
measuring cup, noticed carefully just how much
it measured and then added the same amount
of water, next she flavored it with a few drops
of vanilla or almond or peppermint or strong
coffee or fruit syrup of any kind, and mixed
well.</p>

<p>The confectioner's sugar she thoroughly
sifted through a hair wire strainer, then added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
a little of the liquid mixture at a time until the
cream was sufficiently flexible to be molded with
the fingers. This was then put in a covered
bowl and set away in a cool place for twenty-four
hours to harden.</p>

<p>When this was ready to use Betsey made&mdash;</p>


<h3>Almond Creams</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Blanched almonds.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>First Betsey shelled the almonds, then
blanched them by covering with boiling water
for about a minute (this made it very easy to
slip off the brown skins), next she split them in
two.</p>

<p>Taking some of the cream, she molded it into
balls, pressed flat and put half an almond on
each side.</p>


<h3>Pecan Creams</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Pecans (in halves).</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey's mother bought the pecans already
shelled, as it was almost impossible to shell them
without breaking them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>Taking some of the cream, she molded it into
balls, pressed flat and put half a pecan on each
side.</p>


<h3>Walnut Creams</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Half walnuts.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The cream she molded into small balls, pressed
flat and put half a walnut on each side of the
cream.</p>

<p>Another time Betsey tried&mdash;</p>


<h3>Cherry Creams</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Candied cherries and angelica.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey cut the cherries lengthwise in two,
shaped the cream into small balls and pressed
half a cherry on each side.</p>

<p>The angelica she cut into strips to form
stalks, then stuck a cherry on each. Sometimes
she simply put the cherry inside the cream balls.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The pretty combination that follows was
called&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span></p>


<h3>Neapolitan Cream Squares</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Vanilla flavoring and color pastes.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey's mother had a large marble slab which
she used for rolling out pastry, and this slab
Betsey sprinkled with confectioner's sugar that
had been thoroughly sifted. To the cream she
added a few drops of vanilla and kneaded it in
thoroughly. This she divided into five portions,
leaving one white and coloring the others pink,
green, yellow and chocolate. (Mother always
bought the best flavorings and the same concern
which made these also had color pastes
which were pure and harmless and made according
to government regulations, so mother
bought some for Betsey with directions for
using.) Betsey rolled out each portion alike,
placed one on top of another, pressed the rolling-pin
lightly over them and cut in half-inch
squares with a sharp knife, then placed on
waxed paper to dry.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Cream Peppermints</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">White of</td>
<td align="right">1 egg</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left"><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>Water,</td>
<td align="right">1 tablespoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Oil of peppermint,</td>
<td align="right">4 drops</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (confectioner's).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Chocolate,</td>
<td align="right">3 squares</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey mixed the egg white, water and oil of
peppermint drops in a bowl and added as much
sifted confectioner's sugar as it would absorb.</p>

<p>The board she sprinkled well with the sugar,
then rolled out the mixture to one fourth inch
in thickness, and cut out with a small round
cutter.</p>

<p>While she was busy with this the chocolate
had melted; this she had placed in a good-sized
breakfast cup, and the cup in a small
shallow pan of hot water on the back of the
stove.</p>

<p>Now Betsey took two silver forks and dipped
each round of cream in the chocolate, carefully
draining each one before placing on waxed
paper. Sometimes she needed to melt a little
more chocolate, as the eggs varied in size and
so made more or less accordingly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One of Betsey's schoolmates gave her a recipe
for lemon and orange creams that her mother
often made, so Betsey tried these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>


<h3>Lemon Creams</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Lemon,</td>
<td align="right">One</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Tartaric acid,</td>
<td align="right">A pinch</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (confectioner's).</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>First Betsey grated the rind of the lemon
into a bowl, then added the lemon juice
(strained), the pinch of tartaric acid and sufficient
sifted confectioner's sugar to mold into
small balls which she flattened into cakes. These
she covered with waxed paper and put in a cool
place and they were ready the next day to eat.</p>


<h3>Orange Creams</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Orange,</td>
<td align="right">One</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Tartaric acid,</td>
<td align="right">A pinch</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (confectioner's).</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>As for "Lemon Creams," Betsey grated the
rind of the orange into a bowl, added the strained
orange juice, a pinch of tartaric acid and sufficient
sifted confectioner's sugar to mold into
small balls, which she flattened into cakes.
Sometimes Betsey put a half cup of walnut
meats or pecan meats through the meat chopper
and molded them into the cream.</p>

<p>Then she covered with waxed paper, put in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
cool place and they were ready the next day to
eat.</p>

<p>She also added the nuts to the "Lemon
Creams" when she wanted a change.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<small>STUFFED DAINTIES</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Betsey's mother bought her a pound
of nice fresh marshmallows to make</p>


<h3>Stuffed Marshmallow Dainties</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Fresh marshmallows,</td>
<td align="right">1 pound</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Preserved ginger,</td>

<tr><td align="left">Candied pineapple,</td>
<td align="right">or</td>

</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cooked foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsey found these were very easy to prepare
and most delicious.</p>

<p>All she had to do was to cut the marshmallows
in two, with the scissors, horizontally,&mdash;they
look better this way when stuffed (Betsey
learned in school about horizontal lines, so that
she knew just what mother meant),&mdash;then
place a piece of ginger or a candied cherry or a
piece of candied pineapple or a piece of fig or
raisin or date or part of a walnut, pecan,
almond, butternut or brazil nut, or small flat
balls of the uncooked or cooked foundation
cream on the bottom portion of the marshmallow
and then press the top piece over it.</p>


<h3>Fruit Paste</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Dates (stoned),</td>
<td align="right">1 pound</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Raisins (seeded),</td>
<td align="right">1 pound</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Figs,</td>
<td align="right">1 pound</td>

<td align="right">1 pound</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Nut meats,</td>
<td align="right">2 cups</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>All these Betsey put through the meat
chopper twice, next she put the mixture on the
board and kneaded it well with sifted confectioner's
sugar until she could roll it out to one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
half inch in thickness, then she cut in pieces and
dipped them in granulated sugar.</p>

<p>Mother also showed Betsey how to stuff
raisins and dates, and Betsey found mother's
little sharp-pointed kitchen knife to be just the
thing for this kind of work.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Raisins with Walnuts</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Large fancy table raisins.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Walnut meats.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey slit the raisins down one side carefully,
removed the seeds and pressed in a piece
of walnut cut just the right size, then pressed
the slit together and rolled in powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Raisins with Pecans</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Large fancy table raisins.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Pecan meats.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Slitting the raisins carefully on one side with
a sharp-pointed knife, Betsey removed the seeds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
pressed in a piece of pecan meat, squeezed the
opening together, then rolled in powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Raisins with Almonds</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Large fancy table raisins.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Blanched almonds.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>After Betsey had prepared the raisins by
slitting one side carefully and removing the
seeds, she blanched the almonds she had shelled
by covering with boiling water. Letting them
stand about a minute, then draining off the
water, she removed the brown skins easily.</p>

<p>The raisins were not always large enough to
hold a whole almond so she cut the nut to fit it,
then pressed the opening together and rolled
in powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Raisins with Peanuts</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Large fancy table raisins.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Peanuts (shelled).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey made a slit in each raisin, carefully,
with a sharp knife, removed the seeds and
pressed in a peanut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>After pressing the opening together she
rolled the raisin in powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Raisins with Foundation Cream</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Large fancy table raisins.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey had the foundation cream all made
(see page <a href="#Page_92">92</a>). She prepared the raisins as
usual (slitting carefully on one side and removing
the seeds), then made the cream into small
balls and pressed into the opening, which she
closed. Next she rolled each raisin in powdered
sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Dates with Walnuts</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Best fancy dates.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Walnut meats.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey found that these did not take nearly
as long to prepare as the raisins.</p>

<p>With a sharp knife she cut one side of the
date, removed the long stone, filled it with a
piece of walnut the right size, then pressed and
rolled in powdered sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>


<h3>Stuffed Dates with Pecans</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Best fancy dates.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Pecan meats.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Making an opening into each date with a
sharp knife, Betsey removed the stone and filled
with a piece of pecan meat to fit, and rolled in
powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Dates with Almonds</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Best fancy dates.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Blanched almonds.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>It was a quick job for Betsey to prepare the
dates by cutting an opening and removing the
long stone, but the almonds took longer. These
she shelled, covered with boiling water a minute,
drained them and removed the brown skins.</p>

<p>In each date she pressed an almond, then
rolled in powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Dates with Peanuts</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Best fancy dates.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Peanuts (shelled).</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>After Betsey shelled the peanuts she removed
the long stone from each date by cutting an
opening with a sharp knife, then she filled each
one with a peanut and rolled it in powdered
sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Dates with Foundation Cream</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Best fancy dates.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Foundation cream.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Taking the foundation cream from the refrigerator,
where she had kept it since making
the day before (see page <a href="#Page_92">92</a> for recipe), Betsey
made it into small balls. These she pressed into
the openings of the dates which she had cut and
from which the large stones had been removed,
then she rolled them in powdered sugar.</p>


<h3>Stuffed Figs with Walnuts</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Small fancy figs.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Walnut meats.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Powdered sugar.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>This was the only kind of stuffed figs that
Betsey and mother liked.</p>

<p>The figs were prepared by removing the stem
and cutting carefully down the side, then they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
were pulled apart and a <i>whole</i> walnut inserted.
Next they were pressed together and lightly
dusted with powdered sugar.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Betsey called these her "convenient sweets"
because, as mother said, you could make the
stuffed fruits at any time: winter, summer,
spring or fall.</p>

<p>Betsey's grandmother was keenly interested
in everything her little granddaughter undertook,
and this was especially true of the candy-making.
Grandmother admitted that she had
a "sweet tooth," and Betsey often surprised
her with delicious dainties.</p>

<p>Betsey learned that grandmother was particularly
fond of "Stuffed Fruits," and a few
days before her birthday Betsey prepared some
of each kind, arranged them attractively in a
large box, and on the morning of the eventful
day gave them to a delighted grandmother.</p>

<p>Grandmother was very much pleased with the
pretty box and its "sweet contents." She called
Betsey's gift, "the sweet surprise," because,
as she said, "I never know just what each
dainty contains until I begin to eat it, and,
therefore, I am always being surprised."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<small>CREAM CANDIES&mdash;COOKED</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Betsey</span> wanted to learn how to make the
cooked foundation cream, or fondant as it was
called, and mother gladly taught her.</p>


<h3>Fondant&mdash;Plain</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">3 cups</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cream of tartar,</td>
<td align="right">¼ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water (hot),</td>
<td align="right">¾ cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Vanilla,</td>
<td align="right">½ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The sugar, cream of tartar and water Betsey
stirred thoroughly in the saucepan and let it
slowly come to the boiling point, then she
stopped stirring. After the syrup had been
boiling a few minutes the sugar began to stick
to the sides of the saucepan, but Betsey's
mother took a piece of soft muslin, dipped it in
cold water and showed Betsey just how to wash
it carefully off so that not one grain, even,
should fall into the syrup.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>Then when Betsey tried the syrup by dropping
a little in cold water she was very, <i>very</i>
careful not to stir it. When it formed a soft
ball it was ready to be taken off, and then
mother told Betsey to add the vanilla and pour
the syrup <i>slowly</i> on a large platter.</p>

<p>As soon as it was cool enough to handle
Betsey began to knead it and work the cream
until it was beautifully smooth, then she
wrapped it in waxed paper, put in a covered
bowl, in a cool place, for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>It was then ready to make into candies just
as she did with the uncooked foundation cream
on page <a href="#Page_92">92</a>.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Fondant</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">3 cups</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cream of tartar,</td>
<td align="right">¼ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water (hot),</td>
<td align="right">¾ cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Chocolate,</td>
<td align="right">2 squares</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Flavoring (vanilla),&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
<td align="right">½ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Putting the sugar, cream of tartar, water
and chocolate into the saucepan, Betsey stirred
them well together, then let slowly come to the
boiling point.</p>

<p>After this she stopped stirring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>When the syrup had been boiling a minute
or two and sugar began to stick to the sides of
the saucepan, Betsey took a piece of soft muslin,
dipped it in cold water and very carefully
wiped off <i>every</i> grain, as mother had taught
her.</p>

<p>Even when Betsey tried the syrup in cold
water she took particular pains not to stir it;
when it reached the soft ball stage she removed
the saucepan from the fire, added the vanilla and
poured slowly on to a large platter.</p>

<p>This she let cool, sufficiently to handle, then
kneaded and worked the cream until it was very
smooth.</p>

<p>Next she wrapped it in waxed paper, put in
a covered bowl in a cool place for twenty-four
hours, when it was ready to use for making
candies.</p>


<h3>Coffee Fondant</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">3 cups</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cream of tartar,</td>
<td align="right">¼ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Strong coffee (hot and strained),</td>
<td align="right">¾ cup</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey strained the coffee through a double
thickness of cheesecloth, added the sugar and
cream of tartar and let them slowly come to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
boiling point; when the syrup had been boiling
a few minutes the sugar began to stick to the
sides of the saucepan. As this had to be removed
very carefully so that not even a grain
should fall back into the syrup Betsey took a
soft piece of muslin, dipped it in cold water and
with great care removed every bit.</p>

<p>Even when she tried the syrup to see if it
had reached the soft ball stage Betsey was very
particular not to stir it.</p>

<p>When the candy was cooked Betsey poured
it slowly into a large smooth platter, waited
until it was cool enough to handle, then kneaded
the cream until it was very smooth. Wrapping
the fondant in waxed paper, Betsey put it in a
covered bowl in a cool place for twenty-four
hours. It was then ready to make into candies.</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar Fondant</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Maple sugar (broken small),</td>
<td align="right">2 cups</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cream of tartar,</td>
<td align="right">¼ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water (hot),</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The maple sugar, granulated sugar, cream
of tartar and hot water were all stirred well<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
until they began to boil, then Betsey had to
watch carefully, for sugar began to stick to the
sides of the saucepan. This she had to remove,
which she did by following mother's careful
instructions. She was very particular not to
let one grain fall into the syrup and when she
tried the syrup to see if it would form a soft
ball if a little were dropped in cold water she
took care not to stir it.</p>

<p>Then pouring slowly on to a large platter,
Betsey let it cool until she could handle the
cream, when she kneaded it till it was very
smooth.</p>

<p>The fondant was wrapped in waxed paper,
put in a covered bowl in a cool place for twenty-four
hours and then made into candies.</p>


<h3>Corn Syrup Fondant</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">1½ cups</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Corn syrup,</td>

<tr><td align="left">Cream of tartar,</td>
<td align="right">¼ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water (hot),</td>
<td align="right"><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> cup</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey put all the ingredients in the saucepan
and let them come to the boiling point, stirring
all the while, then she stopped stirring.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>After the syrup had boiled a few minutes,
Betsey noticed that the sugar began to stick
to the sides of the saucepan. So taking a piece
of soft muslin she dipped it in cold water and
wiped all this sugar away so carefully that not
a grain fell in the syrup.</p>

<p>When Betsey tried a little of the candy in
cold water she was again careful not to stir
the syrup, and as soon as it reached the soft
ball stage she removed the saucepan from the
fire and poured the candy slowly into a large
platter.</p>

<p>Then when it was cool enough to handle
Betsey kneaded till it was very smooth and
creamy, wrapped in waxed paper, and put in a
covered bowl in a cool place for twenty-four
hours.</p>

<p>Betsey found that the cooked fondant would
keep a long while and she liked to have some on
hand so that she could make a dish of dainty
candies at any time.</p>

<p>The following are some of the candies made
with the different flavored fondants.</p>


<h3>Plain Fondant Almond Creams</h3>


<h3>Plain Fondant Pecan Creams</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>


<h3>Plain Fondant Walnut Creams</h3>


<h3>Plain Fondant Cherry Creams</h3>

<p>In each case Betsey made the small balls of
the plain fondant, then pressed half an almond
on each side, or half a pecan, or half a walnut
or half of a candied cherry.</p>

<p>Sometimes she put the nut or cherry inside
and wrapped the fondant around it.</p>

<p>With the chocolate fondant she followed the
same idea, making</p>


<h3>Chocolate Fondant Almond Creams</h3>


<h3>Chocolate Fondant Pecan Creams</h3>


<h3>Chocolate Fondant Walnut Creams</h3>


<h3>Chocolate Fondant Cherry Creams</h3>

<p>With the coffee fondant she made</p>


<h3>Coffee Fondant Almond Creams</h3>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>With the maple sugar fondant she made</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar Fondant Almond Creams</h3>


<h3>Maple Sugar Fondant Pecan Creams</h3>


<h3>Maple Sugar Fondant Walnut Creams</h3>


<h3>Maple Sugar Fondant Cherry Creams</h3>

<p>It was with the plain fondant that Betsey
could make the greatest variety of candies.
Every combination that she had made with the
uncooked foundation cream (see pages <a href="#Page_92">92</a>-<a href="#Page_94">94</a>)
Betsey made with the plain fondant.</p>

<p>When she had made Neapolitan Cream
Squares (see page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>) Betsey's mother had
bought some of the color pastes which came
from an old established firm, were quite pure
and harmless, and made according to government
regulations.</p>

<p>So Betsey had these to use, and again she
used the pretty harmless colorings as told on
page <a href="#Page_95">95</a>.</p>

<p>These color pastes last for a very long time,
since very small quantities are used, just a drop
or two being sufficient.</p>

<p>Before Betsey finished her lessons in candy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
making, especially when she made the fondants,
mother's stock of flavorings had very much
increased, for Betsey used vanilla, orange,
lemon, almond, oil of peppermint, wintergreen,
violet, rose and peach.</p>

<p>In fact Betsey became such a little expert in
her candy making that Betsey's father said it
seemed a foolish waste of money for him to buy
the usual box of Saturday candy when he much
preferred his own little daughter's concoctions.</p>

<p>Mother thought this too good an opportunity
to let pass and suggested that he give
the amount he usually spent each week to
Betsey, and leave his order with her.</p>

<p>Father was glad to agree and Betsey was delighted
and proud to think he thought her
capable enough.</p>

<p>This enabled Betsey to form a general supply
fund with which to purchase extras in the way
of different kinds of nuts, candied cherries,
dates, figs, raisins, etc.</p>


<h3>Cinnamon Cream Balls</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Plain fondant.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Ground cinnamon.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>Betsey made the fondant into small balls,
then rolled them lightly in the cinnamon. She
was careful not to have very much as it made
the cinnamon taste too strong.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would put a candied cherry
inside the cream ball, or a piece of a walnut, or
pecan or almond.</p>


<h3>Cocoa Cream Balls</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Plain fondant.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Cocoa.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>These Betsey made like the Cinnamon Cream
Balls by forming the fondant into small balls
and rolling in cocoa or first putting a piece of
any kind of nut or candied cherry inside the
cream.</p>


<h3>Cream Mints</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Plain fondant.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Color pastes.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The plain fondant she divided into as many
portions as she desired colors or flavors.</p>

<p>After coloring and flavoring to her liking
she rolled them out on mother's marble slab<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
until they were about a quarter of an inch thick&mdash;of
course she first sprinkled the slab with
sifted powdered sugar&mdash;then with a little
round cutter Betsey would cut out the mints
and place on waxed paper to dry.</p>

<p>Sometimes she would use the different nuts,
candied cherries, etc., with these by placing a
piece on the top of each round.</p>


<h3>Cream Chocolate Mints</h3>

<h3>Cream Corn Syrup Mints</h3>

<p>Corn syrup fondant, page <a href="#Page_111">111</a>.</p>

<p>Betsey made all of the different kinds of fondants
into mints by simply rolling a portion of
each to one fourth inch in thickness, then cutting
them out with her little round cutter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>When she wanted them to be extra nice she
added the candied cherries or any kind of nut
by placing a piece on top.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Betsey enjoyed celebrating any and every
occasion. The days devoted to St. Valentine
and St. Patrick were hailed with delight. For
these gala days Betsey found the "Cream
Mints" to be the very best candies to make.</p>

<p>A tiny heart-shaped cutter, and another
cutter in the shape of a shamrock, mother
found one day while shopping and these she
brought home to Betsey.</p>

<p>You may be sure that Betsey "bobbed"
more than ever when mother gave them to her.</p>

<p>On St. Valentine's Day Betsey remembered
each member of the family, also each of her little
friends, with a "sweetheart" for a Valentine.
These she made from the "Cream Mints" of
different colors and cut with the heart-shaped
cutter.</p>

<p>The little cutter in the shape of the shamrock
Betsey used on St. Patrick's Day to cut
the "Cream Mints," which she colored a pretty
green.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>


<h3>Bon Bons</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Fondant of any kind.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Color pastes.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Flavorings.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Nuts, candied cherries, etc., etc.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Here was another way in which Betsey used
the fondants.</p>

<p>One portion of plain fondant she put on one
side while the remainder was divided into as
many different portions as she desired different
colors or flavors. When these were shaped
into balls, some plain and some with pieces of
nuts or candied cherries inside, she placed them
on waxed paper while she put the other portions
of fondant in the small double boiler over hot
water to melt.</p>

<p>Betsey did not let the fondant get hot, but
<i>just warm</i>, then taking the candies she had prepared
she dipped each one carefully into the
melted fondant (using two silver forks) and
re-placed on the waxed paper to dry.</p>

<p>In the same manner Betsey used the "Chocolate
Fondant," the "Coffee Fondant," the
"Maple Sugar Fondant" and the "Corn
Syrup Fondant."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>


<h3>Chocolate Creams</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

<tr><td align="left">Nuts, candied cherries, etc., etc.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Chocolate.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Sometimes Betsey liked the chocolate in which
she dipped her creams left unsweetened, then
again she would add a little of the plain fondant
to the melted chocolate to take away the
bitter taste. Betsey melted the chocolate by
placing it in the double boiler over hot water.
The number of squares she melted depended upon
the number of creams she intended dipping.
Usually she started by melting two squares.</p>

<p>The creams she prepared exactly as she did
for "Bon Bons," coloring and flavoring as her
fancy dictated, shaping into balls with or without
the addition of nuts and candied fruits.</p>

<p>With two silver forks Betsey found she could
handle the creams nicely, drain off all the extra
chocolate and place on waxed paper to dry.</p>


<h3>Chocolate Cream Mints</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">

</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Chocolate.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>These Betsey made like the plain cream mints
and other cream mints.</p>

<p>She rolled out the fondant so that it was
about a quarter of an inch in thickness, cut
with the little round cutter, then dipped each
round in the melted chocolate, with two silver
forks, drained off as much chocolate as possible,
then placed on waxed paper to dry.</p>

<p>One of the neighbors, hearing of Betsey's
candy making lessons, sent over a recipe for
"Cocoanut Cakes," and while they were not
exactly candy, Betsey tried them and found
them to be delicious.</p>


<h3>Cocoanut Cakes</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Cocoanut (grated),</td>
<td align="right">½ pound</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">½ cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Whites of</td>
<td align="right">2 large or 3 small eggs</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Flavoring (vanilla),</td>
<td align="right">½ teaspoon</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey beat the egg whites until very stiff,
added the sugar and vanilla, then stirred in the
cocoanut gradually.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Mother had a large tin sheet upon which
Betsey placed waxed paper. Taking a teaspoon
she dropped a spoonful of the mixture at a
time, shaping each cake with the spoon to a
point at the top, then baked in a moderate oven
until they were a golden brown. This made
about three dozen tiny cocoanut cakes.</p>

<p>It happened to be along the latter part of
March when Betsey was making the "Cocoanut
Cakes" and her "dearest friend" Dorothy was
helping too.</p>

<p>Just as Betsey was taking the large tin sheet
full from the oven, the door-bell rang.</p>

<p>Mother had a caller, and as she came in, she
exclaimed, "My, what is it that smells <i>so
good</i>!"</p>

<p>Mother, with a twinkle in her eye, escorted
her caller to the kitchen, where Betsey and
Dorothy, all flushed and excited, were in the
act of piling the cocoanut cakes on a pretty
dish covered with a piece of waxed paper.</p>

<p>Mother's caller could hardly believe it was
possible for little girls of such tender years to
be capable of making the delicious confections.</p>

<p>When she was told of the many kinds that
they really and truly could make, she remarked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
"Well, I certainly have come to just the right
place."</p>

<p>Then mother's caller explained that she belonged
to a patriotic society that was planning
to have a sale in a few weeks. If Betsey and
Dorothy would make her some candy she would
be very grateful.</p>

<p>The little girls were only too delighted and
mother promised to furnish the materials if
they would do the work.</p>

<p>To this they readily agreed and many happy,
busy spare moments they spent in preparing for
(to them) the great occasion.</p>

<p>It would take too long to tell you about the
different candies they made, but every bit was
sold, and when, one morning, they received a
<i>written</i> "vote of thanks" from the patriotic
society, Betsey and Dorothy felt fully repaid
for all their efforts.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<small>SALTED NUTS</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">One</span> day Betsey said, "Mother, I should like
to know how to prepare salted peanuts and
salted almonds," and, as usual, mother was glad
to comply with her request and teach her.</p>


<h3>Salted Peanuts</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Peanuts (shelled),</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter, or</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Olive oil.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Salt.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Betsey bought the peanuts that were not
cooked. These she shelled, then covered with
boiling water for a minute or two. Draining off
the water, she removed the little brown skins
easily.</p>

<p>Using a shallow cake tin, Betsey poured in a
little olive oil (for those who do not like olive
oil, a small piece of butter may be used), added<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
the peanuts, put in a hot oven and cooked to a
light golden brown.</p>

<p>When done she emptied the peanuts on to a
piece of brown paper (this soaked up the extra
oil or butter) and sprinkled lightly with salt.</p>


<h3>Salted Almonds</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Almonds (shelled),</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter, or</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Olive oil.</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Salt.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>These Betsey blanched as she did the peanuts
by pouring boiling water over the almonds for at
least a minute.</p>

<p>Draining off the water, she was able to remove
the brown skins very easily.</p>

<p>The almonds were then placed in a shallow
pan in which a little olive oil or butter had been
melted, then baked in a hot oven to a light
golden brown.</p>

<p>Betsey needed to watch these constantly and
shake the tin occasionally that the almonds
might be evenly browned.</p>

<p>The next step was to pour them on brown
paper and sprinkle lightly with salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span></p>

<p>The brown paper soaked up all the extra oil
or butter and made them much nicer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Next Betsey tried</p>


<h3>Glacé Nuts and Fruits</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Sugar (granulated),</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Corn syrup,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Water,</td>
<td align="right"><small><sup>1</sup>/<sub>3</sub></small> cup</td>

</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Prunes.</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>The sugar, corn syrup and water Betsey
boiled until the syrup became brittle the minute
she dropped a little in cold water. Lifting the
saucepan from the fire, she placed it in a larger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
pan of cold water to stop the boiling immediately,
then she placed it in another pan of hot
water and dipped the nuts and fruits one at a
time.</p>

<p>Betsey used a long hat pin to pick them out
with, then placed on buttered plates or waxed
paper.</p>

<p>These were always made in cold weather and
eaten while crisp. If they were kept any length
of time they became sticky. This, however,
never happened in Betsey's home, for they went
too quickly.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It took Betsey a long time, months in fact, to
learn all these different ways of making candy,
but she was so earnest in her work that the results
were better than many "grown ups"
obtained.</p>

<p>Mother felt fully repaid for the time and
care it had required to teach Betsey and father
was a much "puffed up" man.</p>

<p>He never failed to tell any guests that might
be present when a dish of the home made confections
were being passed that "Betsey made
these" and his pride and pleasure were doubly
increased when they invariably exclaimed, "Impossible!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
Surely a little girl so young as
Betsey could never have made them."</p>

<p>Naturally, Betsey felt glad to have these
nice things said about her candies, and mother
felt still more glad that in spite of all praise
Betsey was not spoiled.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>




<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<small>BETSEY'S PARTY</small></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">When</span> Betsey learned to make Cherry
Creams (on page <a href="#Page_94">94</a>) she said, "Mother, do you
suppose I could have a Washington's Birthday
Party? I could make such pretty things with
these cherries." And mother was so pleased
with her little pupil that of course she said
"Yes."</p>

<p>So Betsey invited five of her little friends:
Dorothy, her very special friend, and Christina,
Isabella, Amy and Adelaide, making six in all,
counting herself.</p>

<p>It was to be very simple; mother made the
cake and ice cream and peanut butter sandwiches,
while Betsey made the candies.</p>

<p>For some days before, Betsey was very busy
making little paper hatchets for favors. On
each of these she wrote one of her little friends'
names.</p>

<p>She made a number of Cherry Creams like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
those on page <a href="#Page_94">94</a> with the angelica, and on the
day of the party she tied three cherries to the
handle of each hatchet with narrow red, white
and blue ribbon.</p>

<p>Mother made a delicious cake in the large
angel cake tin and covered it with a thick white
frosting; before it hardened Betsey pressed half
cherries here and there all over it. Then Betsey
had secured a piece of a fir tree and placed it in
the centre of the cake. On this she hung little
bunches of cherries.</p>

<p>It made a most attractive decoration for the
centre of the table.</p>

<p>Betsey also made "Brown Sugar Nougat" or
"Pinoche" with nuts (see page <a href="#Page_83">83</a>) and
"Chocolate Fudge with Marshmallow Cream"
as on page <a href="#Page_58">58</a>; she also had a dish of the Cherry
Creams on the table.</p>

<p>The six little girls had a very happy time, but
they did wish they could learn how to make
candies, too, so Betsey's mother wrote this little
book in order that other little girls might learn
the easiest and best ways of making candies.</p>

<h2>APPENDIX<br />
<small>Recipes endorsed by the
UNITED STATES FOOD ADMINISTRATION</small></h2>


<h3>Chocolate Dainties</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">Put</span> through the meat chopper one-half cup
each of dates, figs, and nut meats. Add one
tablespoon orange juice, a little grated orange
peel, and one square of melted unsweetened
chocolate. Mold into balls and roll in chopped
nuts or granulated sugar. This mixture may be
packed in an oiled tin, put under a weight until
firm, then cut in any shape desired.</p>


<h3>Old-Fashioned Molasses Candy No. 1</h3>

<p>Boil down molasses until it reaches the hard
crack stage. Pour on oiled plates and cool.
Oil the hands and pull portions of the candy
until it becomes light colored.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>


<h3>Old-Fashioned Molasses Candy No. 2</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Molasses,</td>
<td align="right">2 cups (1 pint)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Vinegar,</td>
<td align="right">1 tablespoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Butter substitute,</td>
<td align="right">2 tablespoons (1 ounce)</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Baking powder,</td>
<td align="right">½ level teaspoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Vanilla or Ginger extract,</td>
<td align="right">1 teaspoon</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Put molasses, vinegar and butter into a saucepan.
Bring to a boiling point, and boil, stirring
all the time until the mixture is brittle when
dropped into cold water. Stir in baking powder
and extract and pour into a buttered tin. When
nearly cold pull until glossy. Cut into small
pieces and lay on a buttered plate or wrap in
wax paper. Sufficient for one pound of
candy.</p>


<h3>Popcorn Candy</h3>


<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="0" summary="recipe">
<tr><td align="left">Syrup,</td>
<td align="right">1 cup</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Vinegar,</td>
<td align="right">1 tablespoon</td>
</tr>
<tr><td align="left">Popped corn,&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; </td>
<td align="right">2 or 3 quarts</td>
</tr>
</table></div>

<p>Boil together the syrup and vinegar until
syrup hardens when dropped in cold water.
Pour over freshly popped corn and mold into
balls or fancy shapes for the Christmas tree.
Little popcorn men will please the children.
Mark in the features and outlines with melted
chocolate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>Either honey, maple syrup, molasses, white
cane syrup or corn syrup may be used.</p>


<h3>Crystallized Fruits</h3>

<p>Use your own preserves. Peach, pear, apple,
quince or watermelon rind will do. Drain from
the fruit all syrup possible. Cut any size desired,
sprinkle with sugar, and dry in the warmer
or a very slow oven. It may be necessary to
sprinkle the fruit again with sugar during the
drying. When dry enough not to be at all
sticky, sprinkle with sugar and pack in layers
with wax papers between. This fruit may be
used for dipping in bitter chocolate for bitter-sweets.</p>


<h3>Fruit Paste</h3>

<p>Put through the meat chopper enough
cherry, peach, or quince preserves to make a
half-pint with the juice. Heat fruit and add
two tablespoons of gelatine, previously softened
in a very little cold water. Stir well, and continue
stirring until it begins to cool and thicken,
then pour into oiled dish to make a layer one
inch thick. Let dry slowly, sprinkle with sugar
and place in box with wax paper between the
layers. A mixture of dried apricots and dates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
may be used for this paste. Wash apricots and
soak over night in enough water to cover. Pour
off water, bring it to a boil, pour over apricots,
and let stand until cool. Put apricots and dates
through meat chopper and proceed with the
proportions as given.</p>


<h3>Fruit Butter</h3>

<p>Chop together equal parts of stoned raisins,
dates and figs and add (after weighing) nuts
equal in weight to the whole. The nuts may be
mixed according to convenience and taste, as
one part of black and white walnuts, pecans,
almonds, peanuts, hazel or Brazil nuts. In
general nuts grown in the locality should be
used. Mix thoroughly and pack in a mold for
slicing.</p>


<h3>Bitter-Sweets</h3>

<p>An attractive variety of candies may be made
by dipping sweet fruits in bitter chocolate. Use
for this purpose dates, citron, candied orange
peel or crystallized fruits. Melt unsweetened
chocolate in a double boiler. Keep the chocolate
just warm enough to prevent solidifying. With
a silver fork drop pieces of fruit in chocolate.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
See that each piece is completely coated, then
remove to wax paper to harden.</p>


<h3>Maple Sugar Candy</h3>

</table></div>
<p>Boil together until soft ball forms in water.
Remove from fire, beat until creamy, add nut
meats and pour into greased tin. Cool slightly,
mark into squares.</p>

cut in bars 1½ inches long and ½ inch wide.

<h3>Substitutes for Christmas Candies</h3>

<p>"What would Christmas be without Christmas
candies!" Can't you hear that wail going
up from children all over the land? And
from many a grown-up, too.</p>

<p>A Christmas shorn of all its sweets isn't
necessary at all. But with a little forethought
and some substitutes in the way of fruit and
nut sweetmeats, we can do much to lessen the
pull on sugar at just this time.</p>

<p>A decrease in our annual Christmas candy
consumption of, say, even one-tenth (and that
isn't asking very much of the "home fighter"),
when multiplied by 100,000,000 of us will provide
much energy-giving food to our army
boys and our needy allies.</p>

<p>And what more acceptable Christmas gift
could we make to those "over there?" Remember
this when you are planning for their
Christmas and your own. It is splendid to
make comfort kits and pack hampers of gifts
for the soldier-boys, but saving the sugar used
to make your Christmas candies and in your
own home is not only making them a Christmas
gift but is putting punch into the right arm
of your country's defenders. And their right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
arm is of more importance just now than your
sweet tooth.</p>

<p>There are all sorts of substitutes such as
stuffed dates, candied ginger, fruit pastes and
salted nuts. Not only dates, but prunes, stuffed,
are delicious. Wash them thoroughly, take out
the seed and slip in a big, fat, sweet almond, and
see how eagerly the children eat it. It is a
food as well as a sweetmeat. Dried fruits like
dates, figs, prunes and raisins have not only
sugar but are highly nourishing. Raisins with
nuts will delight any child and if given with
moderation will not prove indigestible.</p>

<p>A combination of dates, figs and English
walnuts, run through a grinder, softened with
lemon juice, and cut into cakes like caramels,
makes both a wholesome and a toothsome substitute
for candy.</p>

<p>Use more home salted nuts this Christmas
than in previous years. Peanuts, pecans or
almonds, if prepared in olive oil, will not go
begging.</p>

<p>To candy orange or grape-fruit peel means
the use of some sugar, it is true, but less than
for its equivalent in candy, and you are using
up what would otherwise be thrown away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>A wider use of maple sugar as a sweet this
fall and winter will be a helpful conservation
measure. Every one with even one maple tree
in his yard should tap it and boil his own
syrup. Every little bit helps.</p>

<p>Any of these substitutes, if arranged in
fancy box or dainty basket, will serve the same
purpose as candy for gifts; left on table or
tabourette they will give the same festive Christmas
air and fill the munching needs of a holiday
gathering; and best of all, their use will insure
more sugar and therefore more power to those
fighting our war.</p>
